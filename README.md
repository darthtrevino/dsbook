This repo contains sample code for exercises from one of my old undergraduate books on [Data Structures and C](http://www.amazon.com/Data-Structures-Advanced-Approach-Using/dp/0131988476). 

It's been a while since I've written software at that low of a level, so I'm planning on working through the exercises in the book and treating them as a set of Katas.
